--Here the todo list will always be up to date--

When you do something and remove it from the list, make sure to document what you did and why in the diary for the correct date😊


To do list
- 


Gameplan
- get a overview of the code and make a documentation for all elements and requirements to make sure we still have the same functionallyty after the upgrade. 
    - using editor.swagger.io to get overview of endpoints from the api-schema.yaml
- decide on architecture and file structure - eks: now there is 600 lines of code in app.py includes sql insert and endpoints - that is confusing😔
- convert endpoints to javascprit and test them with Postman
- focus on backend first - so we can learn and study a little bit of react and node.js
