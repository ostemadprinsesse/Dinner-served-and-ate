# Done today
## Shift to better-sqlite3
We shifted to better-sqlite3 because Nikoletas computer dident like normal sqllite

## Choosing which branching flow we wanna use
We wanna choose Github Flow - these notes are from Claus' github

Main Idea: Simplified workflow with a single main branch and short-lived feature branches.
Branching: Feature branches created from main and merged back via pull requests.
Merging: Continuous deployment to production after code review.
Best For: Web apps, SaaS, and projects with continuous delivery.
Pros: Simple, encourages frequent deployments.
Cons: Less structure for complex releases; no formal release branches.
