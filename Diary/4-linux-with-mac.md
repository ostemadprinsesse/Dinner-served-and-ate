 Her er et forslag til en klar, struktureret og professionel note, du kan lægge direkte ind i din GitHub‑repo. Jeg har samlet alt det, du beskrev, og organiseret det, så det fremstår som en teknisk changelog / projektlog. Du kan selvfølgelig tilpasse den efter behov.



Project Note – Status & Recent Changes

Port Configuration
- We have now **committed to port 3005** as the standard for local development.  
- The port has been finalized in **package.json**.  
- The Docker environment runs on **port 4000**, while local development without Docker still uses **3005**.

Docker
- **docker-compose** and the **Dockerfile** have now been pushed to the repository.  
- The Docker setup should function as expected after the latest push.

Issue & Project Management (Dinner served at ate project)
- Issue marked as a **bug** (“Something isn't working”).  
- Moved from *Backlog* → *Done*.  
- The issue is now **closed as completed**.

REST API Organisation
- Structure and setup have now been added as part of the REST API organisation.

Tags & Releases
- Work on **tags and the release flow** is ongoing.
