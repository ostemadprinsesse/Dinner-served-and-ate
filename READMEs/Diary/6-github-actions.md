Today only Nikoleta and Linea was in school :(

We learned to create repos via terminel
We also learned about secrets in git that we will use later. 
Here is a link to learn about secrets 😏😏😏😏:

# GitHub actions
We made 
- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md 
    - Does it work like it should ? Ask Claus soon..
    - It creates a message after someone makes an new issue
- PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
    - It needs some SPARKLE 
    - Its is a template for a ... commit-message to a pull request ???
    - The template is here to make sure everybody writes nice and descriptive messages
