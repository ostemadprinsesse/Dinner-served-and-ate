What did we do today in class
- made repo 
- decided on language for the project
- Get a overview of the old code

Chosen language: javascript with node.js (we will do reseach on what this is) and react frameworks

Where is the code today?
- The code was already updated to newer python 3.x instead of 2.x

Problems:
It was hard to trust AI with converting, and we wanted a good and safe architecture. We agreed to split the app.py file into more files:
- one for database - in a folder
- a folder for api-endpoints, prop with 3 files to seperate the endpoints by subject
